A renewed look into Minecraft with a splash of magic...

## Introduction

Ars Magica: Legacy is a port of Mithion's [Ars Magica 2](https://mc-mods.cf/ars-magica-2) for 1.18.1+.

It features an exciting way of creating spells, which can be used in several ways to buff yourself, serve as a tool replacement, fight against mobs and much more!

As of now, the mod is still actively developed. This means that many features are not yet implemented and some may not work yet.

If you want to support the project, you can donate via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/minecraftschurli) or [Paypal](http://paypal.me/minecraftschurli). You can also join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/GcFqXwX).

The old mod's potion bundles were moved into their own project: Potion Bundles ([CurseForge](https://mc-mods.cf/potion-bundles) / [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/potion-bundles)). Be sure to check it out too!

## Dependencies & Compatibility

This mod requires Patchouli ([CurseForge](https://mc-mods.cf/patchouli) / [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/patchouli)) version 1.18-58 or newer for the in-game documentation.
From version 1.2.0 onwards, this mod requires GeckoLib ([CurseForge](https://mc-mods.cf/geckolib) / [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/geckolib)).

This mod has optional integration with [JEI](https://mc-mods.cf/jei), [Curios](https://mc-mods.cf/curios) and [The One Probe](https://mc-mods.cf/the-one-probe).

This mod is not compatible with OptiFine or most similar mods, due to them breaking rendering internals.

## Bugs & Crashes

If your game crashes upon starting, please check if you have downloaded all dependencies in the right versions (see above) and if you are on the newest Forge version.

If it still crashes, please check if it is an incompatibility with another mod. To do that, remove all mods except Ars Magica: Legacy and the dependencies and re-add one mod by another. When you have found an incompatibility, create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Minecraftschurli/ArsMagicaLegacy/issues) (only if none with the same error does not exist yet) and put Incompatibility with &lt;Mod Name&gt;
in the title.

If you found a bug in-game, please report it on [GitHub](https://github.com/MinecraftschurliMods/Ars-Magica-Legacy/issues) as well. Again, please check if a similar issue already exists first.
