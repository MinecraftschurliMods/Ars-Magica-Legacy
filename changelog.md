# Additions

- Creative mode players now have a "Create Spell" button in the inscription table GUI.
- Moonstone ore now spawns in rare meteorites on the surface! These meteorites also have water in them.
- Sunstone ore now spawns in the nether, directly adjacent to lava.
- Celestial Prisms and Black Aurems are now obtainable in survival (and, as a result, so are light and dark Etherium).

# Changes
